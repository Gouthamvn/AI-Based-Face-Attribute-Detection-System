# AI-Based-Face-Attribute-Detection-System
The AI-Based Face Attribute Detection System is a real-time computer vision project that detects Age, Gender, and Emotion from live video input using deep learning models. The system uses OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, and pre-trained models to perform fast and accurate predictions on detected faces.
